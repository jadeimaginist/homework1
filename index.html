  <li><h2>Introduction</h2></li>
  <p>
    The visualization case comes from National Data published by National Bureau of Statistics of China. 
    It's about national foreign currency reserve from 2011 to 2015. 
  </p>
  <li><h2>Why it's confusing</h2></li>
  <p>
    The initial chart emphasised every single value using big circle area but delibrately played down the changes using small circle area.
  </p>
  <li><h2>Justification</h2></li>

  Here I use the line chart to show how the national foreign reserve changes over these 5 years. 
  If using the first way to visualize data, viewers can easily see how the values are big and overlook the changes,
  especially the decline in 2015.
